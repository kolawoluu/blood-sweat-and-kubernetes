## **🔥 LinkedIn Post: Day 1 - Foundation & First Blood**

**🚨 WARNING: This is NOT your typical Kubernetes tutorial.**

Just launched Day 1 of "Blood, Sweat, and Kubernetes" - the most brutal, hands-on K8s bootcamp you'll ever experience. 

**What makes this different?**
✅ We INTENTIONALLY break production-grade clusters
✅ You'll kill container runtimes and watch pods die
✅ You'll delete kube-proxy and break all networking  
✅ You'll crash etcd and recover from disaster
✅ You'll experience 33+ realistic failure scenarios

**Day 1: Foundation & First Blood**
- Break container runtime (containerd) → Watch existing pods survive, new pods fail
- Delete kube-proxy → Break all service networking
- Corrupt iptables rules → Learn why services are just routing rules
- Experience real production failures → Build muscle memory through pain

**This is for:**
- DevOps engineers who want REAL production experience
- Kubernetes practitioners tired of "hello world" tutorials  
- Teams preparing for production incidents
- Anyone who wants to understand K8s by breaking it

**Not for the faint-hearted.**
**Not for beginners.**
**Not for those who want gentle introductions.**

**This is for warriors who want to master Kubernetes through blood, sweat, and tears.**
