## üß™ Lab Part 1: Watch StatefulSets Work (45 minutes)

### Exercise 1.1: Create StatefulSet

```bash
# Create namespace for testing
kubectl create namespace stateful-test

# Create StatefulSet
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
  namespace: stateful-test
spec:
  serviceName: web
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
EOF

# Check StatefulSet
kubectl get statefulset web -n stateful-test
# NAME   READY   AGE
# web    3/3     30s
```

### Exercise 1.2: Watch Pod Creation

```bash
# Watch pods being created
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test --watch

# You should see:
# web-0   Pending
# web-0   ContainerCreating
# web-0   Running
# web-1   Pending
# web-1   ContainerCreating
# web-1   Running
# web-2   Pending
# web-2   ContainerCreating
# web-2   Running

# Pods are created in order: 0, 1, 2
```

### Exercise 1.3: Check Persistent Volumes

```bash
# Check PVCs
kubectl get pvc -n stateful-test
# NAME        STATUS   VOLUME
# www-web-0   Bound    pvc-xxx
# www-web-1   Bound    pvc-yyy
# www-web-2   Bound    pvc-zzz

# Check PVs
kubectl get pv
# Should show 3 PVs bound to the PVCs
```

### Exercise 1.4: Test StatefulSet Features

```bash
# Check pod names
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test
# NAME    READY   STATUS
# web-0   Running
# web-1   Running
# web-2   Running

# Check pod IPs
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test -o wide
# Pods have stable network identities

# Test pod-to-pod communication
kubectl exec web-0 -n stateful-test -- sh -c "curl -s http://web-1"
# Should work - pods can communicate by name
```

---

## üíÄ Lab Part 2: Break #13 - Stop StatefulSet Controller (1 hour)

> **"Time to break the StatefulSet controller. This is where things get really scary."**

### Exercise 2.1: Prepare for Chaos

```bash
# Create test data
kubectl exec web-0 -n stateful-test -- sh -c "echo 'Data from web-0' > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html"
kubectl exec web-1 -n stateful-test -- sh -c "echo 'Data from web-1' > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html"
kubectl exec web-2 -n stateful-test -- sh -c "echo 'Data from web-2' > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html"

# Verify data
kubectl exec web-0 -n stateful-test -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
kubectl exec web-1 -n stateful-test -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
kubectl exec web-2 -n stateful-test -- cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

### Exercise 2.2: Break StatefulSet Controller

```bash
# Delete controller manager pod
kubectl delete pod -n kube-system kube-controller-manager-minikube

# Wait 10 seconds, then prevent it from restarting
minikube ssh
sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml /tmp/
exit
```

### Exercise 2.3: Observe the Chaos

**Watch Terminal 1 (pods):**
- Existing pods keep running
- No new StatefulSet operations

**Test StatefulSet operations:**
```bash
# Try to scale StatefulSet
kubectl scale statefulset web --replicas=5 -n stateful-test

# Check StatefulSet status
kubectl get statefulset web -n stateful-test
# READY: 3/5 (not scaling!)

# Check pods
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test
# Still only 3 pods!

# Try to delete a pod
kubectl delete pod web-1 -n stateful-test

# Check pods
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test
# web-1 is gone, but no replacement created!
```

### Exercise 2.4: Debug the Problem

```bash
# Check controller manager
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep controller-manager
# NOT FOUND!

# Check StatefulSet status
kubectl describe statefulset web -n stateful-test
# Should show: Replicas: 5, Ready: 3

# Check events
kubectl get events -n stateful-test
# Should show: FailedCreate
```

**Key Learning:** 
- StatefulSet controller is critical for StatefulSet operations
- No controller = no scaling, no self-healing
- Existing pods unaffected
- StatefulSet becomes "frozen"

### Exercise 2.5: Fix It

```bash
minikube ssh
sudo mv /tmp/kube-controller-manager.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
exit

# Wait for controller manager to restart
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep controller-manager
# Running!

# Check StatefulSet status
kubectl get statefulset web -n stateful-test
# READY: 5/5

# Check pods
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test
# All 5 pods: Running
```

**Real-world parallel:** This happens when:
- Controller manager crashes
- Resource exhaustion
- Configuration errors
- Network issues

---

## üî• Lab Part 3: Persistent Volume Failures (1 hour)

> **"Time to test what happens when persistent volumes fail. This is where StatefulSet resilience is tested."**

### Exercise 3.1: Test Persistent Volume Failure

```bash
# Check PVCs
kubectl get pvc -n stateful-test
# Should show 5 PVCs

# Check PVs
kubectl get pv
# Should show 5 PVs

# Simulate PV failure by deleting PV
kubectl get pv | grep www-web-0
# Note the PV name

kubectl delete pv <pv-name>
# This will break the PV
```

### Exercise 3.2: Observe the Chaos

**Watch Terminal 1 (pods):**
- Pod with failed PV shows "Unknown" status
- No new pod can be created

**Check pod status:**
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test
# web-0 should show: Unknown

# Check pod events
kubectl describe pod web-0 -n stateful-test
# Should show: FailedMount
```

### Exercise 3.3: Test StatefulSet Recovery

```bash
# Delete the failed pod
kubectl delete pod web-0 -n stateful-test

# Check StatefulSet status
kubectl get statefulset web -n stateful-test
# READY: 4/5

# Check pods
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test
# web-0 should be recreated but stuck in Pending
```

### Exercise 3.4: Fix Persistent Volume

```bash
# Recreate PV
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: <pv-name>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /tmp/stateful-test
EOF

# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test
# web-0 should be Running

# Check StatefulSet status
kubectl get statefulset web -n stateful-test
# READY: 5/5
```

**Real-world parallel:** This happens when:
- Storage system failures
- Disk failures
- Network storage disconnections
- Hardware failures

## üß† Lab Part 4: StatefulSet Scaling (1 hour)

> **"Time to test StatefulSet scaling. This is where you learn about ordered scaling."**

### Exercise 4.1: Test Ordered Scaling

```bash
# Scale up StatefulSet
kubectl scale statefulset web --replicas=5 -n stateful-test

# Watch pods being created
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test --watch

# You should see:
# web-3   Pending
# web-3   ContainerCreating
# web-3   Running
# web-4   Pending
# web-4   ContainerCreating
# web-4   Running

# Pods are created in order: 3, 4
```

### Exercise 4.2: Test Ordered Scaling Down

```bash
# Scale down StatefulSet
kubectl scale statefulset web --replicas=3 -n stateful-test

# Watch pods being deleted
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test --watch

# You should see:
# web-4   Terminating
# web-4   Terminated
# web-3   Terminating
# web-3   Terminated

# Pods are deleted in reverse order: 4, 3
```

### Exercise 4.3: Test StatefulSet Updates

```bash
# Update StatefulSet image
kubectl patch statefulset web -n stateful-test -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"nginx","image":"nginx:1.20"}]}}}}'

# Watch rolling update
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test --watch

# You should see:
# web-2   Terminating
# web-2   Terminated
# web-2   Pending
# web-2   ContainerCreating
# web-2   Running
# web-1   Terminating
# web-1   Terminated
# web-1   Pending
# web-1   ContainerCreating
# web-1   Running
# web-0   Terminating
# web-0   Terminated
# web-0   Pending
# web-0   ContainerCreating
# web-0   Running

# Pods are updated in reverse order: 2, 1, 0
```

### Exercise 4.4: Test StatefulSet Rollback

```bash
# Rollback StatefulSet
kubectl rollout undo statefulset web -n stateful-test

# Watch rollback
kubectl get pods -l app=web -n stateful-test --watch

# Pods are rolled back in reverse order: 2, 1, 0
```
